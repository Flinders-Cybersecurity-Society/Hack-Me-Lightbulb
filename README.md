# Production Install Guide
This guide will take you through setting up a web server to host a production ready version of the hack me light bulb demo.

### Some things you'll need to have setup / access to will be:
- A cloud provider account (This guide uses Oracle Cloud)
    - Even though this won't cost any money, be prepared to enter a debit/credit card for verification
- Access to a Domain Name and ability to access DNS Configuration

## Creating the Web Server

1. Within your cloud provider, create an web instance

![Alt text](guide-files/image.png)
![Alt text](guide-files/image-1.png)

2. Select Ubuntu as the guide-files/image (22.04 is supported by security updates until April 2032)

![Alt text](guide-files/image-2.png)

3. (optional) For a free service with Oracle Cloud, change the shape to a Virtual Machine with Ampere Processor

![Alt text](guide-files/image-3.png)

4. Select CPUs & RAM (2022 - 2023 Server had 1 OCPU and 6GB of RAM)

![Alt text](guide-files/image-4.png)

5. Download both Private and Public SSH Keys (this will be used later for connecting to the server, DONT LOOSE THESE FILES)

![Alt text](guide-files/image-5.png)

6. Create Instance (rest of the default settings are fine, we want a public IP address)

7. Wait for instance to start

![Alt text](guide-files/image-6.png)

## Logging into the Web Server & Installing Required Software
1. Open up a terminal and with the IP address and username from the cloud provider
```
ssh username@IPADDRESS -i "PRIVATEKEYLOCATION.key"
```
![Alt text](guide-files/image-7.png)

2. Update the instance (updates everything and automatically says yes to all recommended updates)
```
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```
- sometimes a restart is required, type in ```reboot``` to restart


3. Install Apache2
```
sudo apt install apache2
```

4. View Firewall rules and allow apache through the firewall
```
sudo ufw app list
sudo ufw app info "Apache Full"
sudo ufw allow "Apache Full"
sudo ufw enable
```
5. Reboot Instance
```
sudo reboot
```

7. Wait a few mins for instance to start again
8. Try going to the IP address in the web browser (HTTP ONLY)
![Alt text](guide-files/image-9.png)
- you should see a page as show above
- don't proceed if you dont get this page
- could be problems with the firewall, apache2 not being installed correctly, firewall rules on the cloud provider

9. Install MySQL and start setup
```
sudo apt install mysql-server

sudo mysql_secure_installation
```

10. Go through the process of setting up MySQL, most questions are security based and different levels of security can be setup

11. Set a secure MySQL password that you can save and use later

12. Once setup finished, run ```sudo mysql``` and something like this should appear:
```
Welcome to the MySQL monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.
Your MySQL connection id is 5
Server version: 5.7.34-0ubuntu0.18.04.1 (Ubuntu)

owners.

Type 'help;' or '\h' for help. Type '\c' to clear the current input statement.

mysql> 
```

13. Type ```exit``` to exit

14. Install PHP
```
sudo apt install php libapache2-mod-php php-mysql
```

15. Changing Apacheâ€™s Directory Index
- you'll want to move index.php to the first entry in the line (see below)

```
<IfModule mod_dir.c>
    DirectoryIndex index.php index.html index.cgi index.pl index.xhtml index.htm
</IfModule>
```

```
sudo nano /etc/apache2/mods-enabled/dir.conf
```

16. Restart Apache
```
sudo systemctl restart apache2
```

## Adding a Domain Name and SSL/HTTPS Setup
17. Add DNS Record to DNS Provider
- We use cloudflare
- Login and select flinderscybersociety.org
- add A record using the config options below

![Alt text](guide-files/image-10.png)

18. Check if going to the domain makes you go to the webserver eg: [beta-oweek.flinderscybersociety.org](http://beta-oweek.flinderscybersociety.org)


17. Get SSL Setup using certbot
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install snapd
sudo snap install --classic certbot
sudo ln -s /snap/bin/certbot /usr/bin/certbot
sudo certbot --apache
```

18. Fill out the questions cert bot asks, pretty easy. If any issues restart with ```sudo certbot --apache```

19. Go to website and check that it has redirected to https:// and that we have the lock icon in the browser

## Moving Web Files onto the server


20. Move into the web directory on the server ```cd /var/www/html```
21. Remove all files in this folder ```sudo rm *```
    - MAKE SURE THAT YOU ARE IN THE FOLDER AS LISTED ABOVE

22. Go to https://github.com/Flinders-Cybersecurity-Society/Hack-Me-Lightbulb/releases and right click the release.zip file and copy the link



23. `cd` to move back to the home directory

23. Run ``wget https://github.com/Flinders-Cybersecurity-Society/Hack-Me-Lightbulb/releases/download/releases/release.zip`` (with the copied link)

24. Install unzip, extract the file and move to web servers directory
```
sudo apt-get install unzip
unzip release.zip
sudo mv src/* /var/www/html/
```
